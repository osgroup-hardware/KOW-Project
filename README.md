After of decade of trying to run more efficient Data Center it is time to tackle the elefphant in the room. 

#Physical infrastructure from steel and concrete is a massive CO2 issue.

Facebook reports that 95% of its CO2 emissions come from Scope 3 (https://plana.earth/academy/what-are-scope-1-2-3-emissions/).
So we started focussing on tackling the big issue, buy designing a modular Data Center that uses as little recources a possible, 
build completely out of wooden infrastructure. 

We working closely with the Open Compute Foundation and various partners to create the best data center with the smallest impact possible.
